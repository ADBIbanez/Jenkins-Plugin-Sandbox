    <h1>Agile Quality pyramid</h1>
    <p>The pyramid shows the status of pipeline triggered tests.
        The test results are represented on the layer which the tests are executed on.
        For example a Selenium test uses the browser, so the test results using Selenium will be plotted
        in the UI part of this graph. At the moment, the Selenium tests are failed so the top part of the
        testing pyramid is red.</p>
